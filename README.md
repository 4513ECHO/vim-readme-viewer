Viewing plugin's README(.md) easily as vim help

## About

vim-readme-viewer help you to view some plugins' README(.md) file easily as
vim help. Viewing vim help is very easy. Only `:help topic`! This plugin usage
is also easy. Please try:

```viml
:DeinReadme dein.vim
:DeinReadme vim-readme-viewer
```

**Note:** This plugin is working only with [dein.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim) now. However, I will
support other plugin managers such as [vim-plug](
https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), [minpac](
https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), [packer.nvim](
https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
